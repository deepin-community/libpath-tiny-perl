Description: file path utility
 Path::Tiny attempts to provide a small, fast utility for working with
 file paths. It is friendlier to use than File::Spec and provides easy
 access to functions from several other core file handling modules.
 .
 It doesn't attempt to be as full-featured as IO::All or Path::Class,
 nor does it try to work for anything except Unix-like and Win32
 platforms.  Even then, it might break if you try something particularly
 obscure or tortuous. (Quick! What does this mean:
 "///../../..//./././a//b/.././c/././"? And how does it differ on
 Win32?)
